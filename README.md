# Grocery Item Classifier

The image classifier being created within this project aims to sort images of "loose" grocery items (i.e. individual fruits, vegetables, bakery items, etc.) by assigning them general to specific labels (i.e. fruit, apple, royal gala).

The dataset will be hosted on figshare (link to come) while the rest of the project will be hosted here.

## Image Dataset
